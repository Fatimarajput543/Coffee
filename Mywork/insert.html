<h1>THE LOCAL STORIES</h1>
<div class="localstories">

<div class="content1">
<h1>DETERMINED TO STAY</h1>

<p>West Bank, Occupied Palestinian Territory

    Umm Saleh and her family live in central West Bank, but each day they remain in fear of settlers. She explained: “A few days ago, we found them sitting on the swing on our outdoor patio, and they threatened to kill us.”
    
    Her son was injured by settlers this year, and her husband stays home most of the time to act as a deterrent. This has led to a severe financial strain on the family.
    
    Violence by settlers, who are often armed, does not happen in isolation. It is one of multiple occupation-related practices that, combined with other actions, shape a coercive environment. The settlers exert pressure on Palestinians to leave their homes and communities. More than 1,500 Palestinians from the West Bank, most of them children, were displaced in 2023.

    <h1>A GARDEN IN BLOOM</h1>
    <p>Elteh village, north-west Syria

        Matra, 55, lives in a camp for displaced people in north-west Syria. Gardening reminds her of her village, and it helps her to forget her sorrow, fears and the conflict unfolding around her. In the winter, the smell of flowers from her garden gives her neighbours in the camp a much-needed respite from the smell of coal.
        
        Camps rarely include gardens or gardening spaces, as they are only temporary shelters until displaced people can return home. However, there is a deep connection between many regional communities and creating gardens; people often take up gardening as a way to exercise some control over their immediate surroundings at a time when they seem to have lost control over broader events.</p>

    <h1>SURVIVING A TRAGIC LOSS</h1>
    <p>Derna, Libya

        Between 9 and 11 September 2023, Storm Daniel flooded and destroyed the coastal areas of north-east Libya and Derna city centre. An estimated 250,000 people were affected, more than 43,000 of whom were displaced. The death toll is estimated at 4,352, while more than 8,000 people are reported missing.
        
        Hamedi, a Libyan Red Crescent volunteer, survived the storm. He explains:
        
        “My mom called me. It was our last conversation. She told me to take care of myself and change into dry clothes so I wouldn't get cold. I saw people being swept away, calling out. Some were saying prayers, and I heard children calling for their baba [father]. I was searching for my house, but I saw nothing, not my house, not our entire neighbourhood. It had disappeared.”

    <h1>RESTORING A HOME</h1>
    <p>Taiz, Yemen

        2023 was the first year for Ghania and her family back in their original home after four years of displacement. They had fled their home in Al-Muzaffar district, in Taiz, to escape the conflict that had reached their neighbourhood. They lived in a rented apartment in Shameer, in the Taiz countryside. Their house in Al-Muzaffar was destroyed during their absence. The family had lost all hope of returning home.
        
        Ghania’s smile was unmatched as she walked into the house with her nephew for the first time since their displacement. The home was restored by Building Foundation for Development, a local UNHCR partner. According to Ghania, the home looks even better than before.
        
        Grateful to those who worked on the restoration project, Ghania says the intervention was a turning point in her life, alleviating the family’s suffering and giving them the opportunity to live a better, more stable and safer life.</p>
